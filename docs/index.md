### Overview
Many streaming content providers rely on IP-geolocation based access restrictions, or geofences, to prevent individuals outside a prespecified geographic region from accessing their offerings. Smart DNS(SDNS) services offer a previously unstudied means of circumventing geofences that is configured to be lightweight and thus to minimize its impact on users' quality of service (QoS).
